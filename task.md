3. Get an email for a successful submission
4. Admins can get emails of submitted forms and then send a pre-formatted  email using checkboxes and Dropdown Menus (Selected, Details, Next Round Details, Rejected)

Learning Focus: Things to Learn in Project 1.

- Implementation of Web Design Practices
- Mapping a user Journey and breaking it down into design & development modules
- Design as a tool for Product Development (Basics)
- Do’s and Don’ts of Web Forms, A Case Study based in Design and Development.


Golden Rules: 
- If it doesn’t look good and professional to the target audience, nobody will care about your web-app. When you’re developing for the web you don’t often have the luxury of a designer with you and most of the times what designs they give you are almost impossible to replicate with high precision. You have to be both the designer and the developer. Design good User Interfaces to have fun while you develop them and feel proud to look at them.
- If the code isn’t readable, understandable and shareable it’s bad. Really Bad. Your code is like your piece of art. It has to be properly formatted, well spaced and composed into concise modules. Looking at a piece of code should explain things clearly. Comments help but it’s better to have the code speak for itself.
- <div>s are like honey bees, you need them to spread out the seeds (ie Modules: meaningful parts of your code) but if you either have too many <div>s for one module it’s going to get difficult for the browser to take care of them. Neither do you want the queen bee (a div that is just massive and is carrying every module at once) out on the front lines that’ll just slow things down. A careful hierarchy is must for both code readability and web performance.
